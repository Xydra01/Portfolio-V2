        Hey there, I'm Eric, but you probably know me better as Xydra. I wear
        many hats – content creator, livestreamer/VTuber, and budding web
        developer. My passion lies in gaming, tech, and science, and I love
        bringing those interests to life through my work. This webpage serves as
        a showcase of my journey in coding and web development. If you're
        curious about what I've been up to lately, simply navigate to the
        portfolio page using the navbar. There, you'll find examples of my
        projects, along with links to their respective Github repositories. But
        it's not all about me – I'd love to hear from you too! Whether it's for
        business inquiries or just to say hi, feel free to reach out using the
        contact form on my page. Thanks for stopping by, and be sure to check
        back often. I'll be updating this page regularly as I embark on new
        projects and adventures.
